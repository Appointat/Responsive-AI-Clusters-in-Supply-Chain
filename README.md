# Responsive AI Clusters in Supply Chain

## Introduction

Welcome to "Responsive AI Clusters in Supply Chain" - a groundbreaking project aimed at revolutionizing supply chain management through the use of responsive, intelligent multi-agent systems.

In the era of accelerated digital transformation, the logistics and supply chain industry faces mounting pressure to optimize operations and enhance efficiency. Traditional warehouse management systems, while functional, often struggle to keep pace with the increasing complexity and dynamism of modern supply chains. This is where the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and specifically, AI Agents, becomes pivotal.

AI Agents, particularly those powered by large-scale models, offer advanced capabilities in data processing, pattern recognition, and decision-making. Their ability to learn and adapt makes them ideal for addressing the challenges of warehouse resource allocation. Moreover, the integration of multi-agent systems, where multiple AI Agents interact and collaborate, opens up new possibilities for intelligent warehouse management.

**Motivation**:
The motivation for incorporating AI Agents into warehouse resource allocation stems from several key factors:
1. **Increasing Data Volumes**: Modern warehouses generate vast amounts of data. AI Agents can effectively process and analyze this data to extract actionable insights.
2. **Need for Real-Time Decision Making**: The fast-paced nature of warehouse operations demands real-time decision-making. AI Agents can provide this, responding swiftly to changing conditions and requirements.
3. **Scalability and Flexibility**: AI Agents can scale their operations according to the warehouseâ€™s changing needs, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in resource allocation.

**Necessity**:
The necessity of AI Agents in this context is underscored by:
1. **Complexity in Resource Management**: Modern warehouses deal with a wide range of variables in resource management. AI Agents can handle this complexity more effectively than traditional systems.
2. **Optimizing Operational Efficiency**: There is a continuous need to improve operational efficiency to stay competitive. AI Agents can optimize resource allocation, reducing waste and increasing productivity.
3. **Enhancing Accuracy and Reducing Errors**: AI Agents, with their advanced algorithms, minimize the likelihood of errors in resource allocation, enhancing overall accuracy.

**Advantages**:
The advantages of using AI Agents and multi-agent systems in warehouse resource allocation include:
1. **Improved Resource Utilization**: AI Agents ensure optimal use of resources, thereby maximizing efficiency.
2. **Enhanced Responsiveness to Market Demands**: AI Agents enable warehouses to be more responsive to market changes and consumer demands.
3. **Facilitation of Predictive Analytics**: AI Agents can predict future trends and demands, allowing for proactive resource planning.

Our project mainly revolves around simulating a supply chain, where the entire supply chain system is roughly composed of a central warehouse and various offline outlets (mainly supermarkets). In reality, there may be multiple central warehouses, but in this program, for the sake of simplifying the simulation, we have implemented a singleton pattern for the central warehouse. All other outlets communicate daily with the central warehouse to receive restocks. Goods are a separate class containing information such as name and quantity. To simplify the simulation program, we have only instantiated four types of products: olive oil, baguette, manchego cheese, black tea.

In our program, we instantiated four outlets and one central warehouse. The central warehouse is an independent AI Agent, whose inventory changes autonomously based on certain conditions (for example, when stock levels are low, the AI might increase the inventory of certain products through other events). Each outlet has its own independent event chain, which is stored in the event.go file. When the date of an event (such as an unexpected incident, holiday, celebration, etc.) matches the current clock date, the event's description will be sent to the AI side. Since each outlet has a unique ID, the AI side identifies which outlet sent the message through the ID and allocates it to the corresponding AI agent.

![Agents](image/agents.png)

In this project, each supermarket outlet is an independent agent. The central warehouse is a special agent, although in this simulation it can be considered as an environment. However, in more complex simulations that may be developed later, the central warehouse should be regarded as an agent distinct from the supermarket outlets.
## Project Background and Prospects

In the actual application process, customers in the location of each outlet have a unified preference. In this project, we have directly assigned a basic description to the local customer preferences of each outlet. Of course, in reality, these preferences can change over time. Theoretically, this aspect could also be managed by AI. If there are multiple central warehouses, then each outlet needs to consider its own inventory status, the distance to each warehouse, among other factors, to choose the most optimal central warehouse for restocking and other operations.
## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing complexity of modern supply chains and the need for more dynamic, real-time decision-making processes. Traditional supply chain mechanisms are often static and can't adapt quickly to the ever-changing market demands or unforeseen disruptions. This project introduces a flexible, scalable solution that not only responds to current conditions but also anticipates future challenges, optimizing the supply chain for resilience and efficiency.

## Principles

Our approach is based on several key principles:

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Harnessing the power of AI agents, each representing entities within the supply chain, enabling decentralized decision-making and fostering robust collaboration.
- **Real-Time Responsiveness**: Ensuring the system is capable of adapting to new events and information, maintaining supply chain continuity and efficiency.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilizing advanced data analytics to forecast demand and supply scenarios, allowing for preemptive strategy adjustments.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Designing the system to be inherently scalable, handling the expansion seamlessly and adapting to various supply chain sizes and structures.
- **Sustainability**: Focusing on long-term sustainability by optimizing resource allocation and reducing waste.

## System Architecture

[Insert a block diagram or flowchart]

The architecture of our system is structured around a central distribution hub, surrounded by retail outlets, each equipped with AI agents. These agents communicate with the central hub to balance supply with demand, share resources, and optimize the overall network performance.

## Prompt Engineering
We have provided some key LLM prompts. In such prompts, we have defined a `TextPrompt` class so that we could enhance development efficiency by adding variables to the prompt. During the design and writing process of the prompts, we encountered many difficulties, such as how to make AI aware of concepts like "duration of transition", "clients' shopping preferences," etc., and requiring AI to consider these complex factors during processing, especially when the length of certain prompts exceeds 2k characters.

There are 3 prompts provided: `Instructor Prompt`, `Assistant Prompt`, and `Format Agent Prompt`. The first two will act as the warehouse center and outlet respectively; they will engage in one-on-one dialogue to negotiate the allocation of goods resources together. Then, the Format Agent will extract key information from the conversation and output it in JSON format to facilitate communication through APIs and goroutines.
