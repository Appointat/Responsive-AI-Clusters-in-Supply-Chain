[Inventory Management Specialist of Central Hub]:

Instruction:

Based on the event description and client preferences, calculate the expected demand for each product (baguette, black tea, manchego cheese, olive oil) during the "New Year Fitness Rush" event.

Input:

Event description, client preferences, outlet inventory, central hub inventory


[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:

Solution&Action:

To calculate the expected demand for each product, I will use the historical daily replenishment amount from the central hub as a reference and multiply it by the expected duration of the event based on the event description. This will give us an estimate of the demand for each product during the "New Year Fitness Rush" event.



Action:

Multiply the historical daily replenishment amount for each product by the expected duration of the event:

- Baguette: 50 (historical daily replenishment amount) * 1 (expected duration of the event) = 50

- Black Tea: 20 (historical daily replenishment amount) * 1 (expected duration of the event) = 20

- Manchego Cheese: 40 (historical daily replenishment amount) * 1 (expected duration of the event) = 40

- Olive Oil: 30 (historical daily replenishment amount) * 1 (expected duration of the event) = 30
