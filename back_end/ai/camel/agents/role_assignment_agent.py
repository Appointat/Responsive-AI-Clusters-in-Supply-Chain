The experts will contribute to the {num_subtasks} subtasks. Please follow the guidelines below to craft your answer:
    1. Remember, your role is to compose the TASK, not to complete the TASK directly.
    2. Action-Oriented Foundation & Building Blocks: Ensure each subtask is actionable, distinct, tapping into the expertise of the assigned roles. Recognize that not every subtask needs to directly reflect the main TASK's ultimate aim. Some subtasks serve as essential building blocks, paving the way for more central subtasks, but avoid creating subtasks that are self-dependent or overly foundational.
    3. Balanced Granularity with a Bias for Action: Details of subtask should be detailed, actionable, and not be ambiguous. Prioritize tangible actions in subtask such as implementation, creation, testing, or other tangible activities over mere understanding.
    4. Contextual Parameters: Please ensure that each subtask has the relevant context information from the TASK to avoid missing or contradicting the context information of the TASK. And try to provide as much information from CONTEXT TEXT as possible here.
    5. Dependencies & Gantt Chart: Identify and account for the dependencies within the subtasks. Ensure that each subtask logically flows from one to the next, or can run concurrently where no subtask is dependent on itself, in a manner that could be efficiently represented on a Gantt chart.
    6. Definitions of the Input of subtask:
        - Interlinking of Inputs: Ensure that the inputs are not siloed and can be interlinked within privous subtasks if necessary, providing a holistic view of what is required for the subtask.
        - Hierarchy and Prioritization: Identify and clearly state the priority and hierarchy (if applicable) among the inputs, ensuring the most critical elements are addressed promptly.
        - Accessibility and Clarity: Ensure that all provided inputs are accessible, clear, and understandable to the relevant team members.
        - Adjustability: Consider that inputs may need to be adjusted as the project progresses and ensure a mechanism for the same.
        - Subtask Dependency: Take into account the dependencies between different subtasks, ensuring that inputs for one subtask are aligned and coordinated with the needs and outputs of other related subtasks.jjj
    7. Definitions of the Task Completion Standard in order to implement a feature in the software that can identify and mark a task as completed:
        - A task is considered completed when its intended output is produced.
        - If possible, the completion standard should be quantifiable to facilitate automatic detection by the software or tool feature.
        - The completion standard should be applicable to common project management scenarios and adaptable to various types of tasks, such as development, testing, and review tasks.
    8. Refrain from mentioning specific titles or roles (who are mentioned in the section of ROLES WITH DESCRIPTION) within the content of subtasks, unless the titles and personal names are mentioned in the TASK.
Your answer MUST strictly adhere to the structure of ANSWER TEMPLATE, ONLY fill in the BLANKs, and DO NOT alter or modify any other part of the template.\n\n\n"""  # noqa: E501

To evaluate the compatibility scores, consider these guiding principles:

    3. Analyze the congruence between keywords or key concepts in the task description and those present in the role description. This will gauge the direct relevance of the role to the task.
    4. Drawing from a comprehensive knowledge base, ascertain the potential value each role brings to the table when it comes to accomplishing the specific task. This evaluation should be based on empirical data or established norms in the relevant domain.
Definition of USER: The user is the role that guides the entire task process. They provide instructions and direction, ensuring that the task aligns with their needs and goals. Users need to utilize their expertise and understanding of the task to propose specific subtasks, expecting the assistant to execute these tasks.
Definition of ASSISTANT: The assistant is the role that executes instructions given by the user. They apply their professional skills and knowledge to complete specific tasks assigned by the user. Assistants must act flexibly according to the user's instructions and provide professional solutions and feedback.
