[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:

Solution&Action:

The specific reason of replenishment for each item in the outlet_inventory can be determined based on the comparison between the future storage amount and the current storage amount:

1. If the future storage amount is greater than the current storage amount, the specific reason of replenishment is to meet the expected demand for the event and client preferences.

2. If the future storage amount is equal to or less than the current storage amount, no specific reason of replenishment is needed as the current storage amount is sufficient for the expected demand.



Action:

Update the JSON template with the specific reasons of replenishment for each item in the outlet_inventory based on the comparison between the future storage amount and the current storage amount for each item.

[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:

Solution&Action:

To determine the transportation duration, we need to calculate the distance between Lyon and Paris, and then estimate the time required for transportation based on the distance. This will require using a mapping or distance calculation service to determine the travel time based on the mode of transportation and the specific route.
