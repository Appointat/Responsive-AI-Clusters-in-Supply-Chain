[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:

Solution&Action:

Based on the event description and client preferences, I calculated the estimated future storage amount for each item in the outlet_inventory. For the baguette, the estimated future storage amount is 495. For Manchego cheese, the estimated future storage amount is 440. For black tea, the estimated future storage amount is 297. For olive oil, the estimated future storage amount is 583.



For the specific reason of replenishment, the calculations result in negative values, indicating that the current storage amount exceeds the maximum warehouse capacity for all items. The specific reason for replenishment is to reduce the current storage amount to the maximum warehouse capacity.



Action:

Update the outlet_inventory with the estimated future storage amounts and specific reasons for replenishment.
