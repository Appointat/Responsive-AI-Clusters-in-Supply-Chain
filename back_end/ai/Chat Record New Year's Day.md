Instruction:

Based on the event description and client preferences, calculate the future storage amount and specific reason of replenishment for each item in the outlet_inventory.

Input:

Event description, client preferences, outlet inventory, central hub inventory, historical daily replenishment amount from central hub, max warehouse capacity.


[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:

Solution&Action:

To calculate the future storage amount for each item in the outlet_inventory, I have added the daily replenishment amount without an event from the central hub to the current storage amount for each item. This will give us the future storage amount for each item. For the specific reason of replenishment, I have subtracted the current storage amount from the maximum warehouse capacity for each item, indicating how much space is available for replenishment.



Action:

Future Storage Amount for Baguette: 250

Future Storage Amount for Black Tea: 100

Future Storage Amount for Manchego Cheese: 40

Future Storage Amount for Olive Oil: 130



Specific Reason of Replenishment for Baguette: 100

Specific Reason of Replenishment for Black Tea: 150

Specific Reason of Replenishment for Manchego Cheese: 400

Specific Reason of Replenishment for Olive Oil: 370
