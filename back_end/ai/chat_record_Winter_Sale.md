I have calculated the future storage amount for each item in the outlet's inventory based on the event description, client preferences, and current storage amount. For baguette, I calculated (50 * 3) which gives 150. For black tea, the calculation is (20 * 3) which gives 60. For manchego cheese, the calculation is (40 * 3) which gives 120. And for olive oil, the calculation is (30 * 3) which gives 90.
