Calculate the future storage amount and specific reason of replenishment for each item in the outlet's inventory based on the known information and client preferences.
Input:
outlet_inventory: {
    "baguette": {
        "current_storage_amount": 200,
        "daily_replenishment_without_envent_from_central_hub": 50,
        "max_warehouse_capacity": 300
    },

    },
    "manchego_cheese": {
        "current_storage_amount": 150,
        "daily_replenishment_without_envent_from_central_hub": 40,
        "max_warehouse_capacity": 400
    },

        "max_warehouse_capacity": 500
    }
},
client_preferences: "Strong demand for Olive Oil and Baguette, moderate interest in Black Tea, minimal preference for Manchego Cheese."

[Event Logistics Coordinator of Outlet]:Solution&Action:
Based on the client preferences and the current storage amount, I will calculate the future storage amount for each item in the outlet's inventory. I will also determine the specific reason of replenishment based on the calculated future storage amount.

For Baguette:
Future Storage Amount = Current Storage Amount + (Daily Replenishment without Event * Transportation Duration)
Specific Reason of Replenishment = "Meeting strong demand"

For Black Tea:
Future Storage Amount = Current Storage Amount + (Daily Replenishment without Event * Transportation Duration)
Specific Reason of Replenishment = "Meeting moderate interest"

For Manchego Cheese:
Future Storage Amount = Current Storage Amount + (Daily Replenishment without Event * Transportation Duration)
Specific Reason of Replenishment = "Meeting minimal preference"

For Olive Oil:
Future Storage Amount = Current Storage Amount + (Daily Replenishment without Event * Transportation Duration)
Specific Reason of Replenishment = "Meeting strong demand"

Action:
For Baguette:
Future Storage Amount: 200 + (50 * 2) = 300
Specific Reason of Replenishment: "Meeting strong demand"

For Black Tea:
Future Storage Amount: 80 + (20 * 2) = 120
Specific Reason of Replenishment: "Meeting moderate interest"

For Manchego Cheese:
Future Storage Amount: 150 + (40 * 2) = 230
Specific Reason of Replenishment: "Meeting minimal preference"

For Olive Oil:
Future Storage Amount: 0 + (30 * 2) = 60
Specific Reason of Replenishment: "Meeting strong demand"
