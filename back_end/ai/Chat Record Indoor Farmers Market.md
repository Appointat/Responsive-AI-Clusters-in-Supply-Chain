Solution&Action:

To calculate the future storage amount for "baguette," I will consider the current storage amount, the daily replenishment without an event, and the maximum warehouse capacity. Based on the event description, "The indoor farmers market will attract a health-conscious crowd," I will predict an increase in demand for baguettes and calculate the future storage amount accordingly.
